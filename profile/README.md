## Season 2022-2023

While Soleil, Matthew, Mia and Yoyo were already very active early 2022, so in 2021-2022, the club was only formed in the 2022-2023 season. And 15 students joined right on the spot.

More details and program code is in the [unity2022](https://github.com/ssis-unity/unity2022) repository. It also containes a [Documentation](https://github.com/ssis-unity/unity2022/tree/master/Documentation) folder.

## Season 2022-2023

Soleil, Matthew, Mia and Yoyo were already very active in the school year 2021-2022, specifically early 2022. As good friends they connected over discord and taught themselves programming, even participating in a hackathon. Finally the club was formed in the 2022-2023 season And 16 students joined in September 2022: 3 freshmen, 4 sophomores, 6 juniors and 3 seniors.
